As overall conclusions I have:

\begin{itemize}
	\item examined other implementations and studied their weak and strong points by using the applications that were free, after which I borrowed their strong points and improved their weak ones
	\item chosen the best available services and tools that fit to my use case in order to provide the best developer and user experience
	\item created an application that is straightforward to use and brought it into a working state into the real world, available to everyone on the internet, that includes acquiring and setting up a domain, setting up services and making them work together	
\end{itemize}
