While the concept of virtual conferences and events is not new, I have attempted to streamline the user interactions in order to provide quick access to what the attenders want. I have analyzed other existent solutions, borrowed their strongest points and tried to overcome what I thought was lacking. I tried to rethink the business logic so smoother experiences can be had. Apart from thinking of an improved business logic, I also was in the position of choosing the best application architecture that will fit to the proposed business rules.

The combination of the ideas and the used cloud services have brought \textbf{Think-In} to an actual tangible product that can be accessed by anyone in the world, additionally, the used technologies and services allow for a very easy extension so that the application can fully scale horizontally. The application can be used by any kind of company since no technical skills are required in order to setup new stages.

I would like to thank my coordinator \textbf{\coordinator} because even from the very beginning she advised me what technologies I should learn and has been alongside me in the decision of the thesis theme and what features are worth adding.
